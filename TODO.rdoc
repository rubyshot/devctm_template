=== "Soon"

* Split email column into +desired_email+ (settable by the user) and
  +verified_email+.  +verified_email+ only gets set after the user follows
  a link he is emailed, and even then he must log in before the the email
  address is considered verified.

=== Eventually

* When you can't log in due to an account not yet being active, the error
  that we get is "1 error prohibited this user session from being saved"

* capistrano

=== Maybe

* live validations
